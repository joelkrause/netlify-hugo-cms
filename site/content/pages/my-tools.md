There's are the tools that I use on a day-to-day, they're always open, and always used... I couldn't live without them!


### VS Code
I use VS Code as my day to day code editor. I currently have about 40 extensions active (seriously need to weed these out) - I'll write a more detailed Code setup in a post.

### CodeKit
CodeKit compiles all my SASS and JS files into neat little packages without touching Terminal!

### MAMP
I use MAMP to run my local development sites

### Sequel Pro
Sequel Pro is what I use instead of the MAMP PHPMyAdmin - it's just easier to fire up the app vs going into the web browser to make changes.

### Transmit 5
FTP App... Not much to say

### Cacher
This is where I keep all my code snippets, it syncs perfectly with VS Code which means I can insert a snippet right into my code without leaving the app.
