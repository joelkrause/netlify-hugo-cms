title: Tools I Use
---
There's are the tools that I use on a day-to-day, they're always open, and always used... I couldn't live without them!


### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
I use VS Code as my day to day code editor. I currently have about 40 extensions active (seriously need to weed these out) - but my main ones are as follows:

- One Dark Pro (My current theme)
- Beautify - used to beautify my code
- Bracket Pair Colorizer - color coordinates my brackets, super handy!
- Cacher - hooks in with the Cacher app
- CSS Grid Snippets - makes life easy :)
- Duplicate action - this allows you to duplicate a file within Code without having to go to the Finder
- WooCommerce - Snippets & autocomplete
- WordPress Development

### [CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com)
CodeKit compiles all my SASS and JS files into neat little packages without touching Terminal!

### [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)
I use MAMP to run my local development sites

### [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com)
Sequel Pro is what I use instead of the MAMP PHPMyAdmin - it's just easier to fire up the app vs going into the web browser to make changes.

### [Transmit 5](https://www.panic.com/transmit/)
FTP App... Not much to say

### [Cacher](https://cacher.io)
This is where I keep all my code snippets, it syncs perfectly with VS Code which means I can insert a snippet right into my code without leaving the app.
